# CZ1107 Data Structures & Algorithms
This module teaches data structures in the first half and algorithms in the second half; C programming language was used. This directory contains my solutions to all assignments, all labs, tutorials with programming questions, as well as some practice questions.

All assignments passed all test cases. The labs, tutorials and practice questions are, to my best knowledge, correct solutions as well.
