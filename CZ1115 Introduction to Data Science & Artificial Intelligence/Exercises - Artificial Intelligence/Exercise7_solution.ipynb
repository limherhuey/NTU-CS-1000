    "You will see *uninformed search* algorithms like `breadth_first_search`, `depth_first_search` and `uniform_cost_search`, as well as *informed search* algorithms like `greedy_search` and `astar_search` in action. The setup is a maze with the problem of finding an escape path from the *start* position to the *goal* position on a two-dimensional grid. You will learn how to map a maze (two-dimensional grid) to a graph, and then apply the search algorithms on the graph to solve the problem. Some of the code is provided, while you will have to fill in some on your own. Give it a shot, and have fun!        \n",
