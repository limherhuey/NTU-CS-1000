# CZ1115 Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
This module teaches data science in the first half and artificial intelligence in the second half. For data science, we used Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib and wrote Python code in Jupyter Notebooks. For artificial intelligence, we used Jupyter Notebooks as well. This directory contains my solutions to all lab exercises for this module.
